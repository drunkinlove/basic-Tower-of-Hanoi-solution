# basic-Tower-of-Hanoi-solution
This program solves the Tower of Hanoi problem for any number of disks (although I haven't tested big ones, will probably take some time).
As I've gathered, this specific solution is often used to teach recursion to future programmers.
Recursion in coding is, basically, a function that invokes itself within its code (once or several times).
